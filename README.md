# RSA Factoring Challenge
A popular public-key cryptosystem for safe data transfer is called RSA. It is predicated on the factoring problem, which is the assumed difficulty of factoring large integers. Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman are the founders of RSA, having published the algorithm's first public description in 1977.
RSA cryptography allows for message encryption using both the public and private keys. A communication is encrypted and can be decrypted with the opposite key. This feature helps to ensure the secrecy, integrity, authenticity, and non-repudiation of electronic communications and data storage, which is one of the reasons RSA has grown to be the most popular asymmetric algorithm.
