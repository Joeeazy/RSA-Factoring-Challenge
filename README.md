#RSA Factoring Challenge
A popular public-key cryptosystem for safe data transfer is called RSA. It is predicated on the factoring problem, which is the assumed difficulty of factoring large integers. Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman are the founders of RSA, having published the algorithm's first public description in 1977.
